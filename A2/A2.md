# A2

11. `yes | yes` - ctrl z dabatae raho doesn't exit
12. `gedit, gedit` fg 1 fg 1

## Hacks

2. `ls -l` displays `a.`, `A2`, then `As` instead of `A2`, `a.`, then `As` in actual.
11. vim & ke  baad quit => ye bash ka issue hai, isme humaari galti nahi
3. `ls | grep *.txt` - `grep *.txt` doesn't work in mine shell as they are glob expansions
13. sleep 100 | pwd => ctrl z => jobs : should display sleep 100 but doesn't work because we have made fork inside a fork and the insider fork gets stuff but not the one we want to.
13. jobs alert ke hijacks the current foreground proc display - happens in real shell too :)
