# A2

## Current problems

1. `ls -l` should display "total" at the top of the output.
2. Sorting of `ls -l` should be case insensitive.
3. Do not use any functions which are not syscalls.
4. `cd ~` should not goto actual home but rather should goto assumed home.
5. `ls -l` doens't work, says no such file or directory error.

Functions to use

- getpid
- fork
  - how to create a new child
  - wait syscall for foreground call to finish
- exec syscalls
  -
