## Current problems

2. Sorting of `ls -l` should be case insensitive.
3. Do not use any functions which are not syscalls.
4. `cd ~` should not goto actual home but rather should goto assumed home.
5. `ls -l` doens't work, says no such file or directory error.
6. `echo 'a'` should print `a` instead of `'a'`.
7. What's the point of putting `ls`, etc. in background job?
8. Fix `"a\nb"` in `echo`.
9. `ls -l X` doesn't work.

## Hacks

1. `ls -l` displays `stat` result instead of actually real data.
