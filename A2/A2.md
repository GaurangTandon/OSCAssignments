# A2

1. Why does `jobs` display stopped jobs (fourth point in `jobs` specification)?
2. Do we need to send `ls &` to background?
3. `ls | grep *.txt` - `grep *.txt` doesn't work in mine shell
4. `sleep 10 &` doesn't work
5. Guess I should also use signal handler since `Error checking status 15466: No child processes` after executing `jobs`.
6. Remove `&` from arguments to process otherwise it tries open file of name `&`.
7. `c1 | c2 | c3 | c4` - all should stop when executing Ctrl-C. Should not require four times Ctrl-C.

## Hacks

2. `ls -l` displays `a.`, `A2`, then `As` instead of `A2`, `a.`, then `As` in actual.
