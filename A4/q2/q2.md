# Automating Biryani Serving

My logic is that the students busy wait as long as some table doesn't become available. And the tables busy wait for the chefs as long as they aren't available. I used mutexes per table and per chef, so that two tables don't overlap on the same chef, and two students don't overlap on the same table.

The chefs do as mentioned in pdf.

```cpp
void* initStudent(void* stTemp)                 // called on thread init
void* initTable(void* tableTemp)                // called on thread init
void ready_to_serve_table(table* table)         // as in pdf
void tablePrintMsg(int id, char* fmt, ...)      // custom printf
void student_in_slot(student* myStud, table* t) // as in pdf
void wait_for_slot(student* myStud)             // as in pdf
void prepBiryani(robot* robot) {
void biryani_ready(robot* robot) {
```

all functions as in pdf. I also maintain a global boolean to keep track of whether all the students have been finished serving or not. In my simulation, the serving table waits for all the students to arrive at the table before it starts serving to them, if there are any more left to arrive.

## Files

1. **colors.h** - defines various colors used
2. **common.h** - common global variables and heade rfiles
3. Rest all different headers and C source files occur in pairs.
4. Three files defined based on the question specifications.
5. A makefile for compilation.
6. **main.c** - for running simulation
