# A2

3. `ls | grep *.txt` - `grep *.txt` doesn't work in mine shell
4. `sleep 10 &` doesn't work
5. Guess I should also use signal handler since `Error checking status 15466: No child processes` after executing `jobs`.
7. `c1 | c2 | c3 | c4` - all should stop when executing Ctrl-C. Should not require four times Ctrl-C.
9. nightswatch should be correctly interrupted on ctrl c and ctrl z.
10. `vim &`; jobs ctrl z;
12. `seq 1000000` => ctrl z => jobs => fg 1 => jobs

## Hacks

2. `ls -l` displays `a.`, `A2`, then `As` instead of `A2`, `a.`, then `As` in actual.
11. vim & ke  baad quit => ye bash ka issue hai, isme humaari galti nahi
